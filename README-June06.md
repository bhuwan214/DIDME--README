### It's june 06 

##### been working little lately , something i get to know these day was about github version control

```github

#list all branches
git branch -a

#switch to the desired branch
git checkout branch-name

#create a branch and switch to that branch 
git checkout -b <branch name>

```

#### To check the connection to the remote or change the remote

```github

# Check the current remote URLs
git remote -v

# Remove the remote origin
git remote remove origin

# Verify the removal
git remote -v


```
